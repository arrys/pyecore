.. _FSM:

Executable Model Example: Finite State Machine
==============================================

As an example, this description re-implements the Finite State Machine (FSM) example as
described in the `ALE tutorial page <http://gemoc.org/ale-lang/tutorial.html>`_.
ALE is a domain specific language designed for EMF Java that provides (_extracted
from the ALE homepage_):

- Metamodel extension: The very same mechanism can be used to extend existing
  Ecore metamodels and insert new features (eg. attributes) in a non-intrusive
  way
- Executable metamodeling: Re-open existing EClasses to insert new methods
  with their implementations
- Interpreted: Just run the behavior on a model directly in your modeling environment
- Extensible: If ALE doesnâ€™t fit your needs, register classes as services
  and invoke them inside your implementations of EOperations.

PyEcore provides the exact same capability to use ALE in a Python environment.
You can find more information about how to add behavior to your metamodel in the
":ref:`behavior`" section of the advanced User Documentation.

The following gives you the full code for the FSM example of the ALE
tutorial page, but in a pure Python style using PyEcore. The script:

- opens the FSM Ecore metamodel from a remote location
- registers the FSM Ecore metamodel in the metamodel registry
- defines additional behavior for each metaclass from the FSM Ecore metamodel
- defines an entry point
- opens a FSM XMI model from a remote location
- executes the loaded metamodel
